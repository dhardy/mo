h1. mo

h4. Synopsis

Mo is a programming language under development. It is:
* Primarily intended to be a compiled language, but an interpreter is also planned.
* Intended as a _systems_ language as opposed to a _web_ language
* Inspired primarily by D, C++, Java, with my own ideas thrown in

The main aims:
* Low-level optimisation is the computer's job, not the programmers.
* Flexibility. As much as possible will be written in the core library rather than being part of the language specification, to maximise experimentation.
* Performance. This is more of an implicit aim, in that it doesn't drive the design, but just keeps it in check.
* Compatibility. Between sources (compiled according to an ABI), with compiled C code (C-ABI compatibility), and automated source translation (C++ to mo and vice-versa).

h4. Components

| "lang":lang/README.textile | The language specification | in progress |
| AST | An annotated syntax tree specification, as a compilation stage and for language-translation | not started |
| ABI | Compiled binary specification, including some optimizations | not started |
| MCT(Mo Compiler Toolkit) | A source-to-AST parser, AST optimizer (according to ABI spec), AST-to-llvm compiler, AST-to-source generator and build tool. | not started |
